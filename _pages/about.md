My name is Jaime Polanco-Jiménez, and I am a dedicated PhD student in Economics at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia. This year, I'm honored to be a visiting scholar under the supervision of Professor [Kristof De Witte](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00049626) at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

I have a passion for applying rigorous economic analysis to address issues related to natural resources, human capital accumulation, economics of education, and development economics. Alongside my academic journey, I'm also dedicated to my wife [Brigitte Castañeda](https://brigitte-castaneda.github.io/), who shares my passion as a PhD student. Together, we're committed to pushing the boundaries of research and knowledge in our respective fields.

<!--  I have a solid educational foundation, including a Master of Science degree in Economics and another Master of Science degree in Oil and Gas Engineering, both earned from Udmurt State University in Russia. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. -->


My research focuses on analyzing  how different factors influence educational outcomes and human capital accumulation, particularly in developing countries. I have been carrying out these research endeavors under the expert supervision of [Oliver Pardo](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-administraci%C3%93n-24?redirect=%2Fprofesores)  and [Gloria Bernal](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-econom%C3%8Da-17?redirect=%2Fprofesores).

<!-- Currently, for my doctoral dissertation, I am investigating the effects of expected income shocks from natural resource extraction on dropout rates. My aim is to provide policymakers with robust evidence to formulate interventions that mitigate potentially adverse consequences on education.
