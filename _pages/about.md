    I am a PhD Candidate in Economics in a joint program between KU Leuven (at the <a href="https://research.kulekuven.be/portal/en/project/3H240489">Leuven Economics of Education Research</a> center) and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-econom%C3%8Da-17?redirect=%2Fprofesores">Gloria Bernal</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00049626">Kristof De Witte</a>.

My research focuses on human capital accumulation at the intersection of Development Economics and the Economics of Education. I use causal inference and data science methods to study how we can improve educational outcomes in developing countries.

My primary research interests include:

*   The impact of educational technology and AI on student engagement.
*   Gender dynamics and peer effects in the classroom.
*   The effects of infrastructure and natural resource allocation on human capital.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">The Double-Edged Sword of AI: Evidence on Student Engagement from the Classroom</h3>
  <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    This paper investigates how the design of an AI educational technology affects student outcomes. Using a large-scale randomized trial with 2,440 secondary students in Belgium, I find that the design of AI chatbots has a powerful, non-monotonic effect on student engagement. A chatbot tailored to the local curriculum increased module completion by 10 percentage points, while a generic chatbot decreased it by 5 percentage points relative to traditional instruction. This effect on engagement is the primary mechanism driving learning: offering the tailored chatbot produces robust gains in knowledge, particularly for students on the margin of engagement. The results show that deep curricular integration is essential for solving the first-order challenge of student engagement in educational technology.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Experience the Future of Peer Review</h2>

<p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  As part of my research into applied AI, I developed this tool to demonstrate the power of multi-agent systems in academic writing. It simulates the rigorous, section-by-section peer review process of a top-tier economics journal.

## Research Highlights

My doctoral research delves into the following key areas:

*   **AI-Powered Learning Support:** Investigating how AI can mitigate teacher shortages and enhance student learning outcomes, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
*   **Gender Composition Effects:** Analyzing the impact of gender ratios in educational settings on student performance and gender equity.
*   **Infrastructure Interventions:** Evaluating the effectiveness of infrastructure improvements on educational access and quality.
*   **Natural Resource Impacts:** Examining the influence of the oil industry on educational outcomes and human capital development in resource-rich regions.
