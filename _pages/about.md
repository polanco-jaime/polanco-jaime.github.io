# About Me

I am Jaime Polanco-JimÃ©nez, a PhD student in Economics at [Leuven Economics of Education Research](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/en/project/3H240489); [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium, and the Department of Economics at [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/).  My research bridges development and Economics of Education to address critical challenges in human capital accumulation.  I am particularly interested in exploring how technology, gender dynamics, and resource allocation influence educational outcomes.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">The Double-Edged Sword of AI: Evidence on Student Engagement from the Classroom</h3>
  <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    This paper investigates how the design of an AI educational technology affects student outcomes. Using a large-scale randomized trial with 2,440 secondary students in Belgium, I find that the design of AI chatbots has a powerful, non-monotonic effect on student engagement. A chatbot tailored to the local curriculum increased module completion by 10 percentage points, while a generic chatbot decreased it by 5 percentage points relative to traditional instruction. This effect on engagement is the primary mechanism driving learning: offering the tailored chatbot produces robust gains in knowledge, particularly for students on the margin of engagement. The results show that deep curricular integration is essential for solving the first-order challenge of student engagement in educational technology.

## Research Highlights

My doctoral research delves into the following key areas:

*   **AI-Powered Learning Support:** Investigating how AI can mitigate teacher shortages and enhance student learning outcomes, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
*   **Gender Composition Effects:** Analyzing the impact of gender ratios in educational settings on student performance and gender equity.
*   **Infrastructure Interventions:** Evaluating the effectiveness of infrastructure improvements on educational access and quality.
*   **Natural Resource Impacts:** Examining the influence of the oil industry on educational outcomes and human capital development in resource-rich regions.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Gloria Bernal](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-econom%C3%8Da-17?redirect=%2Fprofesores) and Professor [Kristof De Witte](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00049626), whose expertise has been instrumental in shaping my research agenda.
