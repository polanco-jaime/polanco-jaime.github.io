# About Me

I am Jaime Polanco-Jiménez, a dedicated PhD student in Economics at [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/) in Bogota, Colombia. Currently, I am honored to be a visiting scholar under the supervision of Professor [Kristof De Witte](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00049626) at [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

## Research Focus

My passion lies in applying rigorous economic analysis to address issues related tohuman capital accumulation, economics of education, and development economics. Specifically, my current research focuses on analyzing how various factors influence educational outcomes and human capital accumulation, with a particular emphasis on developing countries. I conduct my research under the expert supervision of [Oliver Pardo](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-administraci%C3%93n-24?redirect=%2Fprofesores) and [Gloria Bernal](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-econom%C3%8Da-17?redirect=%2Fprofesores).
