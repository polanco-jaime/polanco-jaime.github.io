In addition to my research work, I have served as a Research Assistant at the [Laboratory of Economics of Education](https://lee.javeriana.edu.co/), where I explored the correlation between electrical accessibility and education. I collaborated with Professor [Oliver Pardo](https://cea.javeriana.edu.co/w/facultad-de-cea-profesores-administraci%C3%93n-24?redirect=%2Fprofesores) on understanding the relationship between retirement savings and the informal labor market. Furthermore, I supported Researcher [Christian Posso](https://sites.google.com/site/christianpossosuarez/) from the Central Bank of Colombia in investigating the causal link between health insurance bankruptcy and its effects in Colombia. Additionally, I have contributed as a teaching assistant for econometrics courses under the guidance of Professor [Pablo Garlatti](https://sites.google.com/view/adriangarlati) over the last two years.
