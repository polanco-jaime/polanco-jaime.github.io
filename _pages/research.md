My research focuses on the economics of education, human capital development, and financial inclusion, with a regional focus on Colombia. I use quasi-experimental and experimental methods to evaluate the impact of infrastructure, technology, and policy interventions.

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  This study examines the impact of Colombia's road concession program on educational outcomes in public schools. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, I find that road improvements lead to a significant increase of 0.169 standard deviations in math scores, with the full effect materializing after project completion. Reading scores also show a positive, though less pronounced, trend. These findings are robust to various checks, including alternative estimators and control groups. Additionally, I observe reduced child labor participation and increased higher education pursuit following road improvements. This evidence suggests that Public-Private Partnerships-driven road concession programs can be effective tools for promoting human capital development in developing countries and that policymakers should consider the long-term educational benefits when evaluating infrastructure investments.
