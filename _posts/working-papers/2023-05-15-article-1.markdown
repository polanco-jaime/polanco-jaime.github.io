Road to the Future: Identifying Impacts of Roads on Education in Colombia

This study evaluates the impact of the road concessions program on education in Colombia. The results reveal a decrease in the fraction of students participating in the labor force in schools located near roads, accompanied by an increase in average reading and math scores and the fraction of students completing higher education. The evidence suggests positive effects on the accumulation of human capital, with a stronger impact on public schools compared to private schools. This research provides valuable insights into the potential effects of infrastructure development on the educational outcomes of students in Colombia.

The main findings provide empirical evidence on the relationship between carbon tax implementation and economic growth, highlighting the importance of considering the composition of energy sources in the analysis.

#### Lessons learned
<ul>
    <li>Implementing a carbon tax is associated with an increase in the GDP growth rate in the early years of the climate policy.</li>
    <li>The effect of the carbon tax on GDP growth varies depending on the composition of the energy matrix. In countries with a high share of carbon-intensive energy sources, the carbon tax is associated with a reduction in the growth rate. In countries with a high share of clean energy sources, the carbon tax is associated with an increase in the growth rate.</li>
    <li>The magnitude of the effect of the carbon tax on GDP growth varies depending on the model specification used. The estimated effects range from 0.6 to 1.5 percentage points in the year after implementing the policy.</li>
    <li>The effect of the carbon tax on employment rate is not statistically significant in the first three years after the policy.</li>
</ul>
